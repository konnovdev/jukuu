The app fetches all the data from jukuu.com (raw HTML, because jukuu doesn't have an API).

**Requirements:** 

* Android version: 4.4+

**A word of warning:**

The project is still in its beta phase, with its current state you can use pretty much all that jukuu.com gives you. But there are many feature and refactoring ideas I have for this project, that I hope to implement in 2021, if I have time for that. This readme will be updated if I add new features.
